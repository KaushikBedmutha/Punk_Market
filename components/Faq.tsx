While we respect your right to data deletion, legal and regulatory requirements compel us to retain certain information, such as financial transaction details, and information related to identity verification processes, and anti-money laundering measures, for a specified period. That said, we are happy to accommodate any user request for the deletion of any of your personal data that is not explicitly required to be kept under applicable laws. This typically includes information used for marketing purposes or data related to any additional services you may have chosen to use.',
